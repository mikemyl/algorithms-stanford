# Coursera - Algorithms Design and Analysis (Stanford University)...its an amazing project...

This repo holds my solutions (in Python 3) to the programming assignments for the [Coursera class - Algorithms: Design and Analysis of Stanford University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithm-design-analysis/home/welcome).

I tried to follow the TDD (Test Driven Development) workflow during this
course when applicable (we 're writing python here, so that's one more reason to do extensive testing!) so there exist unittests demonstrating the
functionality of the modules-classes that were developed.

It is not required for our programs that were developed for each assignment to be submitted (in fact, even if we wanted to submit there is no such 
form!) - we only need to provide the final answer. I won't paste the plain result of each assignment here, so one should at least run the main
module of each assignment to get the result. Hopefully, he will have a look at the algorithm :)
